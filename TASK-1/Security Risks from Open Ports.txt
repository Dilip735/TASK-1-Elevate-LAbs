Security Risks from Open Ports:
1.Remote Access Exploits: Weak SSH (Port 22) or RDP (Port 3389) can allow brute-force attacks.

2.Unpatched Services: Exposed HTTP (Port 80) or FTP (Port 21) can have vulnerabilities.

3.Denial-of-Service (DoS): Open ports may be flooded with traffic, disrupting services.

4.Backdoor Access: Telnet (Port 23) and NetBIOS (Port 139) can provide unencrypted access.

5.Exposed Databases: Open MySQL (Port 3306) or MongoDB (Port 27017) may allow unauthorized access.

6.Misconfigured Firewall/Router: Open ports from misconfigurations expose internal systems.

7.IoT Device Exposure: Open ports on IoT devices (like cameras) are frequent botnet targets.

8.Malware/Ransomware: Exposed SMB (Port 445) can spread malware like WannaCry.

9.VPN/Proxy Risks: Misconfigured VPNs or proxies can give attackers network access.

10.Port Redundancy: Excessive open ports increase the attack surface.

Mitigation Tips:
Firewalls: Block unnecessary ports.

Segmentation: Isolate sensitive devices.

Regular Scans: Detect and close unnecessary open ports.

Disable Unused Services: Turn off unused ports/protocols.

Use Strong Authentication: For remote access services like SSH and RDP.
